Wellcome. This is a experimental web app to support
learning courses.

[Demo](https://moritzkemp.github.io/ccm-course_app/)

This web app is a **ccm** app in such a way that its
intention is to compose different components to realise 
the use-case of supporting learning courses.
While its a **ccm** component in that you can configure
and embed it, its not primarily designed to be composed
with other components.
